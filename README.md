## 📁 Files

- **`Titanic-Dataset.csv`** – Dataset containing details about Titanic passengers (age, sex, class, fare, and survival status).
- **`Titanic (1).ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook with the full exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, visualizations, and basic insights.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Perform data cleaning and preprocessing** to ensure data quality
- **Analyze patterns in survival** based on different passenger features
- **Visualize distributions and correlations** through comprehensive charts
- **Extract meaningful insights** from historical data to understand survival factors

## 🔍 Key Analyses Performed

### 📊 Survival Overview
- **Total number of survivors and non-survivors** - Overall disaster statistics

### 📈 Demographic Analysis
- **Survival rate by:**
  - **Gender** - Male vs Female survival comparison
  - **Passenger class (Pclass)** - First, Second, Third class analysis
  - **Age group** - Children, Adults, Elderly survival patterns
  - **Embarked location** - Southampton, Cherbourg, Queenstown comparison

### 💰 Economic Factors
- **Fare distribution vs survival** - Impact of ticket price on survival odds

### 👥 Age Demographics
- **Age distribution of survivors vs non-survivors** - Age-based survival patterns

---

## 📌 Insights Discovered

### 🔍 Critical Survival Factors

- **👩 Gender Impact**: **Women had significantly higher survival rates** than men
- **🎩 Class Advantage**: **First-class passengers** had better survival odds
- **👶 Age Factor**: **Younger passengers and children** had a higher chance of survival  
- **🌍 Embarkation Effect**: **Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg** (C) survived more than those from other ports

### 📊 Key Findings Summary

The analysis reveals clear patterns showing that social factors like gender, class, and age played crucial roles in determining survival during the Titanic disaster. These insights reflect the maritime evacuation protocols of the early 20th century and socioeconomic disparities of the era.
